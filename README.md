# Brain Tumor Segmentation using MATLAB

This repository contains the source code for brain tumor segmentation from MRI images using MATLAB. The project aims to assist radiologists and medical practitioners by providing automated tumor detection and segmentation, helping improve diagnosis speed and accuracy.

---

## Features

- MRI image preprocessing (e.g. resizing, filtering, skull stripping)
- Brain tumor segmentation algorithms implemented in MATLAB
- Visualization of original images, ground truth, and segmented tumor regions
- GUI for user-friendly operation
- Measurement of segmentation performance (Dice coefficient, etc.)

##  How to Run This Project

Follow these simple steps to run the MATLAB Brain Tumor Segmentation project:

---

###  1. Extract the Project

- Locate the archive file:
  
Brain Tumor Segmentation Source Code (2).rar

sql
Copy
Edit

- Right-click → Extract Here (or use WinRAR, 7-Zip, etc.)
- You should get a folder like:

Brain Tumor Segmentation Source Code/
gui.m
preprocessing/
segmentation/
dataset/
...

yaml
Copy
Edit

---

###  2. Open MATLAB

- Launch MATLAB
- Go to:
  
Home → Set Path → Add with Subfolders

yaml
Copy
Edit

- Select the extracted project folder
- Click **Save** and **Close**

---

###  3. Check Dataset Paths

- Ensure your dataset folder paths in scripts match your extracted folder structure
- For example, in `gui.m` or other scripts:

```matlab
datasetPath = fullfile(pwd, 'Dataset', 'Images');
maskPath = fullfile(pwd, 'Dataset', 'Masks');
Update these if your folders are different.

▶ 4. Run the Project
If your project has a GUI, simply run:

matlab
Copy
Edit
gui
Or double-click gui.m in the MATLAB editor and click Run.

The GUI allows you to:
- Select MRI images
- Perform segmentation
- Visualize results
- Save segmented tumor regions

5. Check the Results
Segmentation results are saved in the Results folder

Typically includes:

Original MRI images

Predicted segmentation masks

Overlays of mask on the MRI scan

6. Evaluate Performance
If the project includes evaluation scripts:

matlab
Copy
Edit
evaluateSegmentation
It may compute:

Dice coefficient

Jaccard index

Accuracy

(Adjust this based on your scripts.)

Example Results
(Add screenshots of your segmented images here for better visualization.)

Performance Metrics
Dice Coefficient: XX%

Jaccard Index: XX%

Accuracy: XX%

(Replace with your actual results.)

Dataset
This project uses MRI brain images from publicly available datasets, such as:

BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge)

Custom datasets

(Mention specific datasets you used and cite them properly.)
